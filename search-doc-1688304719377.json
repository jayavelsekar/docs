A short description of why you are suited to this project. This will help the potential client understand why they should choose you for this project. Our recommendation would be to keep it short, explaining the core reason(s) on why you best suited for this project,  The scope of work. Provide a summary of the scope of your work. Are you proposing to take full charge of the project or certain portions of it? Does the scope include specific activities like fieldwork, data cleaning, data modeling, report writing? Do you need anything specific from the client for executing your scope of work? We recommend providing a summary in this field and explaining further in a separate supporting document. There is a provision to do so later in the form.  Project approach/methodology. In this field, you can provide a summary of the specific approach/methodology that you are planning to take to achieve your potential client\\'s objective. Are you planning to use a specific market research or data modeling technique? Again, w[e recommend providing a summary in this field and explaining further in detail in a separate supporting document.

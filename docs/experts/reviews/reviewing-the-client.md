At InsightGig, we believe honest reviews from experts are critical for
clients to know what they did well and where they can improve. Any
insight project is a joint effort; while the expert provides the
service, the role of the client is also critical in specifying needs,
providing the necessary inputs, and so on. We highly recommend leaving a
review for each project you complete on the InsightGig platform!
Similarly, you will receive a review from your client on their
experience on the project with you. 

Accessing review link
---------------------

Once you mark the project as complete and InsightGig Administrator
approves it, you will be able to review the client on your experience.
There are two ways you can do this. 

-   Through the review link on the automated message which pops up on
    the chat application after project completion and approval. It looks
    something like this on the chat window.

-   Through the review link available on the automated email
    notification you receive requesting for feedback. The email looks
    something like this. Do check your junk folder just in case you
    don\'t receive it in the Inbox.

The review form is simple. A star rating on a 5-point scale along with a
descriptive review.

\

Once you provide or receive your review, it is instantly updated on the
respective profile. The review is also displayed on the chat window for
the project, once both parties have provided the review. Not just that,
you get an email notification every time you get a review. In summary,
any review you provide or receive would be hard to miss!

Review on client profile
------------------------

Every time you receive a brief, you can click on the name of the client
on the brief to access their user profile and see the reviews that they
have received so far.

On clicking the name, you will find all the reviews received by the
client on this page.

As an expert, there are two instances when you would need to schedule a
video call with your client or potential client. 

1.  To understand a client\'s brief better. For this instance, there is
    a **Schedule a meeting** button on the top right side of the brief
    (full view).    
2.  While collaborating with a client on a project. For this instance,
    there is a **Schedule a meeting** button on the top left side of the
    project collaboration page.  

Once you click the **Schedule a meeting** button, a dialog box will open
up with a form that allows you to create a video conference call on
Google Meet. In the case of a brief, the call will be a 1:1 with the
client who posted the brief. On the project collaboration page, you
would have the option to choose the participants on the call from the
list of participants collaborating on the project.

Currently, we have an integration with Google Meet for online calls. To
use this feature, you must have created an InsightGig account with an
email ID provided by Gmail or Google Worksapce.

In this article, we will show you an example of using Google Meet from
the project collaboration page. The workflow to schedule Google Meet
from the brief page is similar.   

Linking your Google account with InsightGig   
----------------------------------------------

Before you can start scheduling video conference calls from inside the
InsightGig account, you need to link your InsightGig account with your
Google account. Essentially, you are giving permission to InsightGig
software to access and create meetings in your Google account. **This is
a one time activity**. Lets see how this can be done. 

-   When you click the **Schedule a meeting** button without a link to
    the Google account, you will see this dialog box.  Click on
    **Schedule in Google Calendar** link to proceed further.

-   You will see this screen with a **Sign in with Google** button.
    Click on it to proceed
    further. ![](https://cdn.document360.io/55483967-4645-4b8f-8021-38fbe732305d/Images/Documentation/image-1674401909530.png){.fr-fic

-   You will be directed to Sign in with Google. The screen will look
    like this (looks familiar?!).

-   Proceed to choose the account and sign in with Google. You will need
    to give permission to InsightGig to view and edit your calendars on
    Google by pressing the **Continue** button on this
    screen. ![](https://cdn.document360.io/55483967-4645-4b8f-8021-38fbe732305d/Images/Documentation/image-1674402286753.png){.fr-fic
    .fr-dib}
-   And that\'s it! You are ready to schedule calls on Google Meet
    seamlessly from within the InsightGig platform. Lets see how that is
    done.    

Scheduling Google Meet
----------------------

When you click the **Schedule a meeting** button after the one-time
linking process, you will see a pop-up window with a form.

You need to fill the following information. 

-   **Title**: The title you want to give for the meeting. This will
    correspond to the title field of the meeting on  Google calendar.
    Simple enough!  
-   **Description**: The description of the meeting\'s objective. [This
    will correspond to the description field of the meeting on the
    Google
    calendar.]{style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0.48px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"} 
-   **Starting date & time**: The starting date & time of your meeting. 
-   **Ending date & time**: The ending date & time of your meeting. 
-   **Collaborators**: If you click the **Schedule a meeting** button on
    the project collaboration page, you will see this additional field.
    You can choose which of the collaborators should be part of the
    meeting. This field will not be visible when you click the
    **Schedule a meeting** button on the brief.   

Once you fill up al the fields, the **Create meeting button will
activate. **Click on it and you are done! You will see a temporary
message just below the **Schedule a meeting** button indicating that the
meeting has been scheduled.

Your **Inbox** is where all your projects are organized and available
for you to collaborate. You will probably be using it frequently, almost
every time you use the platform. 

Whether you a client or an expert, you can reach the **Inbox **by
clicking the link on top right of the screen.

drafted and sent the proposal to the Client Lead.  

**Collaborator**: All projects where you were invited by other users
(Client accounts in your own firm) to collaborate will be displayed
here.

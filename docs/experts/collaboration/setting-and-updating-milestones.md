Setting interim milestones are a simple and effective way to track the
progress of any project over time. We highly recommend setting interim
milestones for every project executed on the InsightGig platform, be it
a short project lasting one week or a long one lasting several weeks.
Milestones ensure that you and your client are always on the same page
on the progress of a project, and any delay in meeting a milestone can
be addressed quickly before the point of no return.   

Setting milestones
------------------

The option to set up milestones will be available on the project
collaboration page once the Client completes the initial payment (if
applicable) as agreed upon by both parties at the proposal approval
stage. Once the payment is completed (if applicable), InsightGig Admin
will open out the milestone feature on the project collaboration page.
On the image below, you can see the activated **Milestones** section.
You are now ready to add milestones! Even if you forget to add
milestones, you can expect a reminder email from us! :)

To create a milestone, you need to click **Add a milestone** and add the
following information for the milestone on the project collaboration
platform. 

-   The date on which the milestone will become due. 
-   A title for the milestone. For example, it could be \'Data
    cleaning\'. 
-   A short description of the milestone. For example, it could be
    \'Clean the data provided by the client, and make it ready for
    analysis.\'

Once you add a milestone, you can view it on the project collaboration
page and the client will be notified by email. You will also see a
message on the Chat section, indicating that a milestone has been
added.

Milestone are automatically sorted chronologically. You can add them in
any order and watch them get sorted chronologically based on their
respective due date!

Editing and deleting milestones
-------------------------------

To edit a milestone created earlier, expand the three-dot menu as shown
in the image below and click on **Edit milestone**. If you would like to
delete a milestone, select **Delete milestone**. Each of these actions
will trigger email notifications to the client.

Marking milestones complete
---------------------------

When a milestone is achieved, you can mark it as **Complete **and move
to the next task. To do so, check the box next to its title. The status
will be updated on the chat, and the client will be notified by email.
Congrats on completing a milestone!

As discussed in a previous article, **Private Briefs** are sent to you
directly. When you receive a private brief, you will be notified by an
email which includes a link to view the brief. The email will look like
this.

Private Briefs land in your Inbox
---------------------------------

The briefs you receive are available in your **Inbox **(the link on the
notification email also direct you here). The **Inbox** is your one-stop
destination for all your projects. We will discuss them separately in
another article. You can access the **Inbox** by clicking the link on
the top right of the screen.

Once you click on the link in the Inbox, you will reach the
collaboration page. 

> This page will be active till the end! You can send a proposal to the
> client, and continue to collaborate on it if your proposal is
> selected.

On the collaboration page, you can do the following. 

-   Send a proposal 
-   Decline quoting for the brief 
-   Chat with the client
-   Schedule a video call (Google Meet supported)

For a detailed overview of how to send the proposal, please read [this
article](/v1/docs/creating-proposals). Once you send the proposal, it
will be available on the collaboration page. You can even edit the
proposal based on discussions with the client from the same page. Lets
take a deeper look on how to create and edit proposals in the next
article.

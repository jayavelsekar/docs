If you are part of a firm or an enterprise with multiple users on
InsightGig, you can collaborate together and get stuff done! To do so,
you would need to create a **Firm**. The user who creates the Firm
becomes the Admin. The Admin can add Team Members to the firm. Team
Members are colleagues who work with you at your firm. For all active
Admin and Team Members, the platform will add the name of the firm on
each profile, which other users will be able to see.

Best practice!

If you are part of a firm with multiple users on InsightGig, always use
your organization\'s email address (like user\@awesomecompany.com).
Several collaboration features on InsightGig rely verification using
email domain name. For example, you cannot invite a user with another
email domain name on to your firm.

:::

Indicating that you are a firm has several advantages. For example, some
clients on the platform may prefer to deal with a firm having multiple
users on the platform as they have higher resource requirements for
their projects.   

Creating a firm
---------------

-   Click on the main menu on top right of your screen. Choose **Add
    firm**.

-   On the first screen, enter your firm's name and select **Save
    firm**.

Pro tip!
:::

::: {.content}
Always select a firm name that matches your company name. That will make
it easy for others to recognize you. In most cases, your email domain
name would also be the same or quite close! 
:::
:::

-   Once you have created your firm, you will be the only member, with
    the role of **Admin**. You now need to add team members.

.fr-dib}

-   Click on the **+Invite a new member** button to send invites to
    others. [You will only be able to send invitations to users who have
    the same email domain name as yours. So if your email is
    <user@awesomecompany.com,> then you can only invite users with email
    IDs with domain name,
    [\@awesomecompany.com](mailto:user@awesomecompany.com,). Invited
    users will have the role of a **Team Member**. Before they accept
    the invite, the status will be **Pending**. Once they do, the status
    will change to **Active**.

-   If you already have an account on InsightGig with the same email ID
    as the one on which you received he invite, you just need to log in
    to the platform and click on the **Accept Invite** button from the
    same browser while you are logged in.
-   In any other case, you would be redirected to the **Sign Up** page.
    You can create an account and then click on the **Accept Invite**
    button from the same browser while you are logged in.

[Once you accept an invite to join a firm, you will be able to see
yourself as a **Team Member** in the **My Firm** section of the main
menu. ]{style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0.48px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"}

Closing a firm
--------------

Only the Admin of a Firm can close the firm. On closing a firm, all the
accounts associated with the account, Admin as well as Team Members,
will go back to being individual accounts with no firm attached to their
profile. To do so, simply click the **Close Firm** button on the **My
Firm** page.

![](https://cdn.document360.io/55483967-4645-4b8f-8021-38fbe732305d/Images/Documentation/image-1676874284389.png){.fr-fic
.fr-dib}

You will see a dialog box asking for confirmation.  

![](https://cdn.document360.io/55483967-4645-4b8f-8021-38fbe732305d/Images/Documentation/image-1676874373327.png){.fr-fic
.fr-dib}

On clicking **OK**, the Firm will be closed. 

Transferring ownership 
-----------------------

You can also transfer ownership of a **Firm**. The **Admin** can
transfer ownership to any other **Team Member**. The **Transfer
Ownership** button is available on the **My Firm** page. 

![](https://cdn.document360.io/55483967-4645-4b8f-8021-38fbe732305d/Images/Documentation/image-1676875235381.png){.fr-fic
.fr-dib}

On the next screen, the **Admin** will have the option of choosing the
**Team Member** to whom the ownership needs to be transferred. Only
**Active** Team Members would be displayed in the list. 

![](https://cdn.document360.io/55483967-4645-4b8f-8021-38fbe732305d/Images/Documentation/image-1676875335361.png){.fr-fic
.fr-dib}

On choosing a user, the ownership will be transferred. The original
Admin will become a Team Member in the same firm, once ownership is
transferred.

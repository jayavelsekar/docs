We strongly recommend updating your **account settings** and **profile
settings** information immediately after your account is activated.
Updating both these sections on InsightGig is relatively simple and only
requires a few minutes. In this article, let\'s see how you can easily
do so!

Updating account settings 
--------------------------

The **account settings **section (direct link
[here](https://insightgig.com/account/contact-details)) contains your
contact information. It can be accessed by clicking the circular profile
icon on the top right, next to the **Inbox** hyperlink and choosing
**account settings**. Initially, the circular icon will contain two
letters (first letter of your first and last name). Once you upload your
profile picture, the letters will be replaced by the picture.

----------------------------------------

Your Insight Partner profile page is a one-stop showcase of your
qualifications, certifications, work and project experience, and
services offered. Your potential clients should be able to fully
understand your capabilities from the information available on this
page. The more details you offer in this section, higher the chance that
you will receive appropriate enquiries from potential clients. Needless
to say, we highly recommend spending a fair amount of time developing
and updating your profile page and keeping it updated with the latest
information at all times! In this article, we will take you through the
process of setting up your all-important profile page.     

-   If you are starting out for the first time, you will see a link on
    the top right of your screen after logging in called **Create/Edit
    Profile** on the top right of your screen. This text will change to
    **Insight Partner profile** once you have created your profile. The
    profile view lets you evaluate your profile the same way clients
    will see it. You can also find the same options under the **menu**
    by clicking the circular profile button on the top right of the
    screen.

    redirected to the Profile Builder directly. If you have already
    built your profile once, you will reach your profile page. On the
    top right of the profile page screen, you can click \'Edit Profile\'
    to reach the Profile Builder.

### Packages

Packages are insight services that have been pre-specified to a certain
extent. They make it easier for prospective clients to understand the
service being offered, the methodology adopted to deliver insights, how
they can use the output for their benefit, the likely timelines, and the
cost. Adding appropriate packages to your profile helps clients discover
you more easily as the text in them are searchable by potential clients.
**This field is also searchable; clients looking for specific keywords
might discover your profile if they use the terms mentioned in the
description of the package.  **

You will see four different headings here. Under each, you will find
several packages which you can choose to add to your profile if you feel
you have the expertise to execute them successfully.  

-   Market Research 
-   Customer/Employee Experience 
-   Immersion & Innovation 
-   Data Analytics 

In the future, we will be building out more features around packages.
For example, clients who would like a particular standard package could
use them to auto-populate a brief and send them to all experts who
indicated that they have the expertise to execute them. Watch this
space!

*Note: This section is optional, but we suggest you take some time out
to choose the packages that you can offer to potential clients.*

### Availability

What are your typical working hours? It\'s a good practice to indicate
your typical availability times in this section. You can always change
them later if the situation changes. Don\'t forget to choose your time
zone as well!

![](https://cdn.document360.io/55483967-4645-4b8f-8021-38fbe732305d/Images/Documentation/image-1670950981303.png){.fr-fic
.fr-dib}

*Note: The information provided in this section is currently not
displayed on your profile. In the future, we will use the data in this
section for building out features like disallowing appointments at times
when you are marked as not available. *

### Background Image

How about a nice background image to give your profile a great halo? Or
an image that showcases your work? For instance, if you specialize in
IT, you could upload something relevant to that field. For reference,
this is where your background image appears. 

*On expert search listings. *

.fr-dib}

*Note: Uploading a background image is optional, but we highly recommend
doing so. A good background image can make your profile stand out in
search as well as make your profile page look great. (The above images
are probably not a great example! ) *

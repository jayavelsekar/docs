# InsightGig - An Overview

Hello and welcome to InsightGig! On this page, we will give you a brief overview of the platform. We also provide hyperlinks to several other articles, to make it easier for you to navigate the site. If you are new to InsightGig, we recommend reading this article to familiarize yourself with the platform before diving deeper. Let's start!

InsightGig aims to simplify how insight professionals get to insight. To begin with, it provides a platform where professionals seeking insight (Clients) can collaborate with those with the ability to provide it (Experts or Insight Partners). We take the route of a 'reverse marketplace' to achieve this. 

:::note What is a reverse marketplace?
In a traditional marketplace, sellers post their product or service and source buyers. In a reverse marketplace, as the name suggests, the buyer indicates their requirement of a product or service they wish to buy, and seller(s) then bid for the requirement.

As you will see while using the InsightGig platform, we offer several other features to make it easy to collaborate on projects and get to insights faster.

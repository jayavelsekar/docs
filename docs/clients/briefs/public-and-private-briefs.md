You can either choose to post a brief publicly or send them privately to
specific expert(s) on the InsightGig platform. Choose to post publicly
when you would like to maximize the number of experts who quote for your
requirement OR if you don\'t want to look for specific expert(s) of your
choice on your own. Choose to send requirements privately when you are
particular about the experts whom you would like to work on the project.
 

Public Briefs
-------------

Publicly posted briefs can be viewed by all the experts registered on
the InsightGig platform. This lets you reach multiple experts at the
same time, maximizing your chances of getting proposals. Post reviewing
the proposals, you can accept or decline one or more proposals. To post
a brief publicly, follow the initial steps for [creating a
brief](https://insightgig.document360.io/v1/docs/creating-a-brief) and
select **Post Brief Publicly.**

Your brief will be visible to all the Insight Partners registered on the
InsightGig platform. They will be able to search for your brief and send
a proposal if they feel they have the expertise to meet your objective.
When you post a brief publicly, experts have to search for your brief on
the platform. Each expert is not notified via mail about a new brief
being available for them to consider.

-   By sending a brief privately, you have established 1-1 communication
    with the specific expert. Therefore, a collaboration page will open
    up with the title **You\'ve sent a brief to \[INSIGHT PARTNER FIRST
    NAME\]**. The transaction page has several features including a 1-1
    chat option. We will discuss about this page later in the
    **Collaboration** section.

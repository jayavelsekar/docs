My Briefs
---------

Once a brief is created (public or private), it will be saved in your
\'**Manage Briefs\'** section. The section can be accessed as follows by
clicking the circular menu icon.

This lists all the briefs you have posted publicly and privately. Here,
you will also find the briefs that you created partially (at least went
past the first section). You can always choose to finish them later or
delete them.  

Editing a brief
---------------

To edit a brief, follow these steps.

-   Go to the **My Briefs** section
-   Find the brief you want to modify and click on its title.

.fr-dib}

-   Once the brief opens up in full view, click on **Edit Brief** on the
    top right of the page to modify it. The process for modifying the
    brief is exactly the same as [creating
    one](https://insightgig.document360.io/v1/docs/creating-a-brief).

Closing a brief
---------------

You can also close a brief, i.e. stop it from being displayed on the
public listing. This is relevant when you have found the expert of your
choice and no longer want additional proposals to be received. Click on
the three dots displayed on the top-right of the brief of your choice
and select **Close Brief**.

Reopening a brief
-----------------

To reopen a closed brief, click on the \'**Open Brief\'** button
displayed at the bottom of a closed brief. The brief will become live
again on the listing and be searchable by experts.

At InsightGig, we believe honest reviews from clients are critical for
experts to know what they did well and where they can improve. We highly
recommend leaving a review for each project you complete on the
InsightGig platform! Similarly, you will receive a review from your
expert on their experience on the project with you. 

Accessing review link
---------------------

Once you mark the project as complete and InsightGig Administrator
approves it, you will be able to review the expert for the work done on
your project. There are two ways you can do this. 

-   Through the review link on the automated message which pops up on
    the chat application after project completion and approval. It looks
    something like this on the chat window.

.fr-dib}

-   Through the review link available on the automated email
    notification you receive requesting for feedback. The email looks
    something like this. Do check your junk folder just in case you
    don\'t receive it in the Inbox.

The review form is simple. A star rating on a 5-point scale along with a
descriptive review.

\

Once you provide or receive your review, it is instantly updated on the
respective profile. The review is also displayed [on the chat window for
the
project]{style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0.48px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"},
once both parties have provided the review. Not just that, you get an
email notification every time you get a review. In summary, any review
you provide or receive would be hard to miss!

Review on expert profile
------------------------

You can take a look at all the reviews received by an expert so far on
their profile page. It will be available at the bottom of the page for
each expert. It is one of the data points you can use while choosing an
expert. Yet another reason for you to leave a review every time you
complete a project!

Zoom is a cloud-based video conferencing service that allows you to host
and join online meetings with your team members, clients, or anyone
else. You can use Zoom to schedule calls on Insightgig and invite
participants via email. Zoom offers many features to enhance your online
meetings, such as screen sharing, chat, breakout rooms, polls,
reactions, and more.

Scheduling a meeting in InsightGig can be done in two places to achieve
two different goals.

1.  To understand an expert\'s profile better before sharing the brief.
    For this instance, there is a **\'Schedule a meeting\'** button on
    the profile page [(full
    view)]{style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0.48px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"}
    of each expert on the platform.    
2.  While collaborating with an expert on a project. For this instance,
    there is a **\'Schedule a meeting\'** button on the top left side of
    the project collaboration page.  

Once you click the **\'Schedule a meeting\'** button, a dialog box will
open with a form allowing you to create a video conference call on
Google Meet or Zoom. In the case of the profile page of an expert, the
call will be a 1:1 with the expert from whose profile you initiated the
meeting. On the project collaboration page, you can choose the
participants on the call from the list of participants collaborating on
the project.

Zoom and Google Accounts required!

You can connect your personal or organizational Zoom account to schedule
meetings on our platform. However, if you want to manage the call (such
as rescheduling or canceling it), you must also integrate your Google
account. This is because Zoom does not allow you to modify the meeting
details without logging in to their platform. By integrating your Google
account, you can use the Google Calendar feature to change the time,
date, and other relevant information about the meeting.

In this article, let\'s see how you can use Zoom from the project
collaboration page. The workflow to schedule a Zoom meeting from the
brief page is similar.

Linking your Zoom account with InsightGig   
--------------------------------------------

Before you can start scheduling video conference calls from inside the
InsightGig account, you need to link your InsightGig account with your
Zoom account. Essentially, you are giving permission to InsightGig
software to access and create meetings on your behalf. **This is a
one-time activity**. Let\'s see how this can be done. 

-   You will see this dialog box when you click the **Schedule a
    meeting** button.  Click on the \'**Zoom**\' logo to proceed
    further.

You need a Zoom account (to generate the meeting link) AND a Google
account (to generate calendar invite) to use this feature.

Scheduling Zoom Meet
--------------------

When you click the **Schedule a Meeting** button after the one-time
linking process, you will see a pop-up window with a form.

You need to fill in the following information.

    correspond to the title field of the meeting on  Google calendar.
    Simple enough!  
-   **Description**: The description of the meeting\'s objective. [This
    will correspond to the description field of the meeting on the
    Google
    calendar.]{style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0.48px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"}

Once the expert completes the last milestone and delivers the final
outcome, it is now time to bring the project to a close! This is a very
simple to do on the InsightGig platform. 

-   On the top right of the project transaction page just above the chat
    window, you might have already noticed a button on the top right,
    **Mark project as complete**! This is visible only to you as a
    client, and not the expert.

-   After you click on the above, you will see a dialog box.

-   Once you press **Confirm**, you will see the following message on
    the chat window. Further, the expert would be notified by email that
    you have marked the project as completed.

-   Insightgig Admin will also be notified about your request to close
    the project. We will get in touch with you for processing the final
    payments (if any). Once that is done, InsightGig Admin will confirm
    project completion. You will see the following message on the
    platform.

-   Post InsightGig Admin confirmation, you as well as the expert will
    receive an email notification for reviewing each other on the
    project.

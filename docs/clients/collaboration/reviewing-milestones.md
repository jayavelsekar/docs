[Setting interim milestones are a simple and effective way to track the
progress of any project over time. We highly recommend experts to set
interim milestones for every project executed on the InsightGig
platform, be it a short project lasting one week or a long one lasting
several weeks. As a client, our advice would be that you insist on them
as well! Milestones ensure that you and your expert are always on the
same page on the progress of a project, and any delay in meeting a
milestone can be addressed quickly before the point of no return.

be available to the expert on the project collaboration page once the
initial payment (if applicable) is completed as agreed upon by both
parties at the proposal approval stage. Once the payment is completed

the project collaboration

Clients cannot create, edit, delete milestones or mark them complete.
All experts (Expert Lead, Expert Invitee, and Third Party Expert)
working on a project can do so.

Reviewing milestones
--------------------

When the expert **adds/edits/removes/completes** a milestone to the
project, you would be notified by email, with a direct link to the
project collaboration page.

.fr-dib}

On the collaboration page, you will see the expected completion date of
each milestone, the title of the milestone, and a short description of
the milestone.

Make sure each of the milestones matches your expectation as per the
approved proposal. Short projects lasting a week could have 5 milestones
for each day of the week while longer projects could have a milestone
for each week. The number depends on several factors like length of the
project, your comfort level with the expert, the importance of
completing the project on time, the significance of certain milestones
etc. Over the course of the project, you can monitor milestone
completion as per the committed timeline. 

If you need any changes or clarifications on any the milestone, you can
chat with the expert on the project collaboration page.

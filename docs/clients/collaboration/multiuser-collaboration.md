In some cases, you would need multiple users to collaborate on a
project. On the InsightGig platform, you can easily invite other users
or get invited yourself to the project collaboration page!

As of now, multi-user collaboration is possible after the proposal from
the Expert Lead is accepted by the Client Lead. It is not possible to
collaborate on the platform before

### Project Roles 

On InsightGig, any user collaborating on a project can have one of these
roles. 

**Client Lead**: The Client account who initiated the project, i.e.
created and posted/shared the brief. They can invite Client Invitees to
collaborate on a project.

**Client Invitee**: A Client account who is invited by the Client Lead
to collaborate on the project. They have to be in the same **Firm **as
the Client Lead. 

**Expert Lead**: [Expert who sent the project
proposal]{style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0.48px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"}
for the brief. [They can invite Expert Invitees and Third Party Experts
to collaborate on a
project.]{style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0.48px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"} 

**Expert Invitee**: An Expert account who is invited by the Expert Lead
to collaborate on the project. They have to be in the same **Firm **as
the Expert Lead.

**Third Party Expert**: Any third-party expert who is invited by the
Expert Lead to collaborate on the project. They need not be in the same
firm as the Expert Lead. 

*The above roles are at a project level, and not at a Firm level.
Therefore, any Client account can be a Client Lead for a project. They
could be an Admin at a Firm, Team member at a Firm or an independent
Client account not linked to any Firm.*

### **Inviting other users**

As a Client Lead, you can invite other Client Invitees from your Firm to
collaborate on a project. It just takes three steps! 

-   Open the project collaboration page and expand the **Collaboration**
    section.
-   Click on **Invite another user, **enter the** **user's email
    address, and click on **Send Invitation**.
-   The user will be notified by email to accept the invite to
    collaborate on the project.
-   If you invite a user outside those in your Firm or an expert, error
    messages will be displayed.

The email to collaborate on a project looks like this. The Client
Invitee needs to click the link on this email and proceed to accept the
invitation inside the InsightGig platform.

The invitation link will open directly from the email only if user is
already logged in to the platform. If you find yourself on the home page
after logging in, simply click the link on the invitation again from the
same browser where you are logged in beforehand. You will be able to see
the accept invitation page.

For Client Invitees, the project will appear under the **Collaborator**
tab in the Inbox.

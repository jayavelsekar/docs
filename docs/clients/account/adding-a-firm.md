If you are part of a firm or an enterprise with multiple users on
InsightGig, you can collaborate together and get stuff done! To do so,
you would need to create a **Firm**. The user who creates the Firm
becomes the Admin. The Admin can add Team Members to the firm. Team
Members are colleagues who work with you at your firm. For all active
Admin and Team Members, the platform will add the name of the firm on
each profile, which other users will be able to see.

Best practice!

::: {.content}
If you are part of a firm with multiple users on InsightGig, always use
your organization\'s email address (like user\@awesomecompany.com).
Several collaboration features on InsightGig rely verification using
email domain name. For example, you cannot invite a user with another
email domain name on to your firm.
:::
:::

Indicating that you are a firm has several advantages. For example, if
you are part of a reputed firm, experts may have a higher inclination to
bid for your projects.  

Creating a firm
---------------

The user who created the firm automatically becomes the **Admin**. The
Admin has certain special priveleges not available to others in the
firm, such as the ability to edit the firm\'s page that is visible to
other users. You can pass the Admin rights to another user in your firm
at a later stage. At any point of time, there can only be one Admin of a
firm.

-   To create a firm, click on the main menu on the top right of your
    screen. Choose **Add firm**.

-   You will reach a page where you can enter the following details of
    your organization.
    -   Firm name (mandatory)
    -   Logo 
    -   Background banner 
    -   About us: A brief description of your firm. 
    -   Type of firm (Pvt. Ltd., Public Ltd. etc.)
    -   Countries of operation
    -   Website
    -   Industry/Sector that your firm belongs to (can add more than
        one). 
    -   Department/Team name
    -   Firm size (number of people)

Pro tip!
:::

::: {.content}
Always select a firm name that matches your company name exactly. That
will make it easy for others on the platform to recognize you. In most
cases, your email domain name that you use to login to the platform
would also be the same or quite close!

Adding team members to a firm
-----------------------------

-   Once you have created your firm, you will be the only member, with
    the role of **Admin**. You can now add other users, who will join
    with the role, **Team Members**. On the main menu, you would notice
    that the section which was named **Add Firm** earlier is now called
    **My Firm** now. This is the section to visit when you need to tweak
    anything with regard to your firm.

-   In **My Firm, **go to the section called **User Management** and
    click on the **+ INVITE** link to send invites to others. The image

    able to send invitations to users who have the same email domain

-   If you already have an account on InsightGig with the same email ID
    as the one on which you received the invite, you just need to click
    on the **Accept Invite** button. If you are already logged in to the
    platform on the same browser, you will see a page where you can
    accept or decline the invitation. If you are not, you need to log in
    to the platform before being able to view this page.

-   If you do not have an account on InsightGig with the email ID on
    which you received the invite, clicking on Accept Invite would
    redirect you to the **Sign Up** page. You can create an account, and
    once approved, click on the **Accept Invite** button again to accept
    the invite.
